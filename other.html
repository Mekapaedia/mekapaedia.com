I last updated this site on Thursday 30th of June, 2020.
<br><br>
This website is run off of a small <a href="https://www.scaleway.com">Scaleway</a> VPS Linux server, utilising <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/">Debian 9 Stretch</a> as the operating system.<br>
The webserver is a fork of <a href="http://acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a>, a great static/CGI http server, called <a href="https://github.com/blueness/sthttpd">sthttpd</a>; which adds a few security patches.<br>
SSL/HTTPS is handled through <a href="https://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a> using a <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> certificate. Basically, this simply redirects the HTTPS queries to the static HTTP server, 
meaning that the HTTP server doesn't need to deal with the specifics of SSL and the SSL layer doesn't need to know anything about HTTP. Simple and secure, hopefully.<br><br>

The website itself is all just static hand-coded HTML and CSS. It's not the most efficient nor pretty; but it's simple, fast, portable, secure, and I think does the job fine.<br><br>

<!--Below is a joke, please do not judge me for the awful inline CSS-->
<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;background-image:url('./other/background.gif');background-repeat:repeat;color:#ff00ff;text-align:center;">However, it wouldn't be a real static HTML website without a ridiculous 3D rotating GIF, so here you go:<br>
