I have worked in IT and studied in Software Engineering and Mechatronics. I've worked a fair bit with CAD and system administration as well as embedded programming. 
I enjoy problem solving and design, so if you know of a job going in those areas (<i>especially</i> if it is remote!) <a href="mailto:rkharvey@mekapaedia.com"><em>please let me know!</em></a>

<h3><a href="./Resume.pdf">My CV</a></h3>
<br>
I started playing around with computers in high school, specifically Linux and later programming in C. I later went into an engineering degree at the University of Calgary, where I eventually went into Software Engineering.
I learned a lot about building programs, such as languages like C/C++, Java, little bit of VB.Net; and did a fair it of embedded programming. I also learned about software elements like databases, object-oriented programming patterns, 
networking, compilers, and data structures/algorithms; as well as softer skills like software team building, requirements engineering, testing, functional/non-functional requirements, and Agile practices. 
I learned about computers themselves, too; in classes about basic electronics, digital logic, instruction set architectures, hardware architectures, memory organisation and caching.<br><br>

During this time, I also started working in a competition team where I helped to design model aeroplanes for the <a href="https://www.saeaerodesign.com/">SAE AeroDesign competition</a>. Being primarily into automobiles,
my plan before starting university was to join the FSAE team (which I did but they didn't have much for me to do), I only joined because the week before university I had being playing around with a personal
project (which I never finished) to design a trans-atlantic remote controlled flying wing! I started in <a href="http://www.schulichaerodesign.ca/">this team</a> testing various wing profiles in 
<a href="https://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/javafoil.htm">JavaFoil</a>, and ended up becoming the the president of the team for around 3 years. I didn't achieve much success in that club, 
with none of the planes making it to the competition (two crashed in testing days before, one got stuck in US customs, and one never made it off the drawing board!) but I designed two of the planes largely by myself; 
and learned a lot about aerodynamics, structures, manufacturing, and team leadership in those 4 years. I handed the team off to much more capable people, who have done a much better job since.<br><br>

Between each of my years of university I also worked, starting with jobs like working in petrol stations and delivering food; I finally got my first IT job after finishing my second year of university at the <a href="https://www.yyc.com/">Calgary Airport</a>.
Working at the airport was quite eye-opening to me, as I finally got a taste of front-line IT helpdesk work. Some days I would be doing very little (cataloguing inventory) and some days I would be absolutely flat out in 
entering tickets into the tracking software as they came in all day, trying to manage getting IT service tickets sent to the correct groups while also taking in the flood of requests. During my time there I also
started to develop some tools on my own to help out with issues I saw (that I wished I kept!), like an Excel spreadsheet that estimated monitor failure based on an averaged MTBF of the backlight 
and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a> and a GUI powershell script to automate the onboarding of new employees to the Active Directory system.<br><br>

Subsequent to that, after my 3rd year of university, I went on a 16 month internship as was the norm at the time. My internship happened to be with the university itself, as an IT Intern in the IT deparment of the School of
Engineering. During my time there, I learned a lot. I worked initially with Microsoft SCCM, deploying software and system images, then started maintaining a legacy Linux system left behind by a member of staff who had passed away.
I eventually worked with professors and my collegues to convert this system to Windows, as it made little sense to be maintaining a Linux server and 40 Linux clients for just one part of the school of engineering, 
when everthing else was Windows based. I worked on this largely of my own accord, and led the meetings with the professors at that time. We decided on using Cygwin to keep the most of the functionality they were using 
in Linux. I also worked with software packaging for the big three operating systems (specifically Matlab on Windows, Linux, and OS X) for research students who required access to that on their own machines which we
did not directly manage but provided some software support. I also did odd jobs like sorting out/replacing non-functioning computers, helping with setting up and deploying the images for the next academic year, 
sorting out printer issues, and writing documentation for users. I did well enough that after my internship I was asked to start on part-time during my final year of university, and I continued to so support work
and occasional bash/linux work up until a couple months before graduation.<br><br>

In my spare time during my internship, I started playing around with the <a href="http://www.cs.colby.edu/djskrien/CPUSim/">instruction set architecture simulator CPUSim</a> in order to figure out what the minimal reasonable 
(i.e.: not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer">OISC</a>) computer would be, using a 4-bit architecture (not serial). This was interesting enough that for my final year project in university I
managed to recruit 14 other people to form a group to design and build a simple educational computer kit based around an extremely simple 4-bit instruction architecture, utilising only commonly available 7400-series chips.
This project was called <a href="https://github.com/Nibble-Knowledge">Nibble Knowledge</a>. Because it wasn't on the list of industry provided projects, it was required to be run as an entrepreneurial project, meaning we 
had to have mock investor meeting, present the ideas in front of other entrepreneurs, and attempt to find prospective buyers (we found one local to us, in the field of alternative education).<br><br>

As the founder, leader, and head system architect; I learned an enormous amount about computers, especially architecture at both the instruction set and hardware levels, system buses, digital timing, digital design, digital logic, and computer memory.
I also learned a lot about team leadership, organisation, and managment. I received good peer feedback on my leadership all three peer review reports 
(<a href="./Peer-Feedback-RyanHarvey-Dec-2015.pdf">Early project</a>, <a href="./Peer-Feedback-RyanHarvey-Jan-2016.pdf">Mid project</a>, and <a href="./Peer-Feedback-RyanHarvey-Feb-2016.pdf">End of project</a>). The aim for the 
project was extremely ambitious - a self-built computer on a breadboard capable of 5mhz, 16MB of addressable memory, VGA graphical output, PS/2 keyboard input, audio output, IDE hard drive interface, and ethernet (later serial) connectivity. 
Everything was made from discrete 7400 series logic chips, and besides the VGA being somewhat unfinished, and the ethernet being swapped for serial and then finally dropped; the system worked as designed and exceeded all 
of our supervisors' expectations. It was an exceptional body of work by the team, and to this day the lessons I learned are extremely valuable. <a href="./nibblepics.html">Pictures of the system itself can be seen here</a>, along
with a <a href="./Nibble_poster.pdf">detailed poster explaining the project here</a>. As part of the project, an educational book was written detailing the functioning of the machine, which can be

After finishing my undergraduate, I went looking for a challenge.So I moved to Spain, and started taking classes in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vigo. I eventually left that university as it wasn't right for me, 
but during my time there I participated in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uvigomotorsport/">a Formula Student team</a>. There, while learning Spanish, I worked on embedded programming. Specifically, I worked on the 
electric servo control of the gearshift of the motorcycle gearbox using a chinese clone of an arduino nano. It didn't turn out to be a very good controller, gearshifts were exceptionally slow (had to use the clutch!), but 
it was a valuable learning experience in embedded programming, servo control, and working in an engineering team in a different field. I also worked a bit in reading and logging sensor data, specifically that of the Mass 
Airflow Sensor, but that was more a learning lesson in the possible inaccuracies of analogue to digital conversion than anything else! I also worked in translation, both for the team and also for a Spanish technology company
called <a href="https://www.imatia.com/">Imatia</a>, and while it paid pretty well per hour it definitely wasn't for me.<br><br>

During my time in Spain, I decided I needed a change, so I applied for an <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/courses/taught/automotive-mechatronics">Automotive Mechatronics MSc at Cranfield University</a> - 
and to my great surprise, was accepted. After travelling to the UK and speaking with the professors personally, I decided that a 
<a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/courses/taught/advanced-motorsport-mechatronics">Motorsports Mechatronics MSc</a> was of more interest to me, and they allowed me to switch to that program instead. I was very glad I did. 
I was able to draw on both my mechanical and software experience, and learned a huge amount about vehicle dynamics, vehicle powertrains, data collection and analysis, vehicle electronics and communications, 
sensors, control theory and implementation, physical system modelling, and various mechatronic systems in current vehicles. <a href="./damon.jpg">I also got to meet and speak with Damon Hill</a>, which was pretty cool. 
My thesis for the masters was on a software architecture for a novel multiactuated test platform that was in the works, which was to work with both onboard and offboard processing. The work I did on that platform contributed 
to me being offered a (thankfully, fully-funded) PhD position at Cranfield, which I accepted as I completed my masters.<br><br>

During my PhD, which I decided to leave after around a year due to a combination of a life re-evaluation and its negative effect on my mental health, I focused on the design of a novel 1/5th scale multiactuated vehicle platform;
as well as its place within the state-of-the-art, its localisation, its powertrain, and the communication system for the offboard computing system. The platform is "multiactuated" as it has independent four wheel steering an 
wheel motors, so the angle and torque of each wheel can be varied independently. The vehicle itself was to be about half a meter long, made of aluminium stock and cut sheet/plate, and weighed 15kg. It used four skateboard electric 
motors (around 1.8Kw each), as well as four high speed RC servos. The overall plan for the platform was to generate real-world data on existing controllers for multiactuated vehicles, which could then be fed into the current 
research for autonomous vehicles - allowing them to achieve greater manoeuvrability, especially in cases of emergency situations. I am sad that I could not continue with the PhD research as it was extremely interesting 
and the people I worked with were fantastic and leaders in their fields, but it was not the right place for me. I recieved good feedback on my work, though, and learned a lot about controllers and vehicle multiactuation as well 
as refining my skills in CAD, FEA and manufacturing.<br><br>

Now here I am! Looking for a new job ideally in the field of Software Development, DevOps, System Administration, or Embedded Development - or anything else interesting to do with computers!<br>
Please, <em><a href="./index.html">drop me a line</a></em> if you are looking for someone with an eclectic mix of skills like mine. Cheers!<br><br>
