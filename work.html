I have worked in IT and studied in Software Engineering and Mechatronics. I've worked a fair bit with CAD and system administration as well as embedded programming. 
I enjoy problem solving and design, so if you know of a job going in those areas (<i>especially</i> if it is remote!) <b><a href=" mailto:rkharvey@mekapaedia.com">please let me know!</b></a>
<br>
Obivously this could use a little more explanation but I am close to dinner time and hungry.
