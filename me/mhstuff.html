I've struggled with mental health issues for a long time now. Since I was 5-6, I struggled with self-image and self-loathing, culminating in depression and anxiety as I got older. Part of the reason for this is untreated
ADHD, which to date (30th June 2020) is still untreated as the waiting list for adults getting ADHD diagnosies in England is quite long.<br><br>

Untreated ADHD made school and university challenging in its own way: it's difficult to succeed when you cannot begin. However, for the most part, I was able to compensate by a burst of frenzied work at the last minute, 
or being lucky with what I had memorised for the exams. I finished my first degree with relatively success, and then moved on to a second (undergraduate) degree in Spain.<br><br>

This was a much more challenging time for me. Over the two years I lived in Spain, my state of mental health got progessively worse: first, ADHD made it hard to work at all, then depression made it hard to get out of bed, 
then anxiety made it hard to leave the house. This cycle culminated in leaving school, leaving all extracurricular activities, and becoming almost totally isolated; only going outside for food and visiting my (at the time) 
girlfriend, who lived a 6 hour drive away. I would not speak to anyone for a month or more at a time, and the unhealthy relationship did not help either. I was able to get out only with a lot of financial assistance from 
my parents, as well as getting an offer for a masters in the UK (which I accepted). This experience has worsened my existing conditions, however, and I feel fundamentally changed my perspective and self-image.<br><br>

In the UK, I struggled quite a lot with the masters. It was very intensive, and very difficult. Luckily, I met my current partner not long after moving there, and have been in a very supportive relationship since. 
This has really helped my mental health. As well, after around a year living in the UK, I was finally diagnosed with (severe) depression and (severe) anxiety; and started both medication (Sertraline, originally at 
50mg but now up to 200mg which is the maximum) and therapy. This has helped a fair bit, but obviously not solved the issues. I managed to pass the masters and was offered a fully-funded PhD position at the same university, 
which I accepted.<br><br>

However, as we all know, COVID-19 was to come. Combining that situation with the difficulty of starting and completing work at home, the stress of the PhD, and our continual borderline financial state took a toll 
on my mental health yet again. Eventually I came to the decision that I needed to leave the PhD, as I simply could not continue to operate under the immense pressures: I was regularly having heart palpitations 
each morning, and was stressed out contintually. It was not productive, and was certainly not pleasant.<br><br>

And how here we are! I am still on the path to recovery, taking my medication, and waiting for that ADHD diagnosis. I still have all the same issues, but I do think they are managed a bit better now. I just wish 
I could have had them diagnosed and managed a little earlier in my life, but unfortunately you cannot turn back the clock.<br><br>
