Hello. My name is Ryan! I'm an English-born, Canadian-raised nerd currently residing in Cambridge (techically <a href="https://www.lode.org.uk/">Lode</a> but who knows where that is?). 
<a href="./me/me.jpg">This is what I look like (when welcoming people to Chilli's)</a>, if you were curious. 
<br><br>
I have studied a fair bit of computer and vehicle related things, and am currently working for <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM</a> as a Modelling Engineer at their Cambridge office.
<br><br>
I am basically interested in anything human-made that moves or computes, especially if it was built in the mid-20th century. I also love bookends of any subject - the best and the worst, slowest and fastest, oldest and newest, etc.
<br><br>
I have had this webspace for ages but I've only recently had the motivation to properly redo this website. I used to have my email hosted here too, but I had a lot of issues with it being marked as spam even <em>after</em> I got all the DKIM stuff sorted. C'est la vie I suppose.
<br><br>
I hold a <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/undergraduate/explore-programs/software-engineering">BSc in Software Engineering</a> and an <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/courses/taught/advanced-motorsport-mechatronics">MSc in Motorsports Mechatronics</a>; 
and I studied for a period in <a href="https://eei.uvigo.es/eei_es/estudos/graos/enxenaria-mecanica/">Mechanical Engineering</a> and did around a year of <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-opportunities">PhD research</a> on multiactuated vehicles.
<br><br>
During my time at University in Calgary, I headed up a team that designed a 4-bit computer from scratch built out of 7400-series chips called Nibble Knowledge - <a href="./work/nibblepics.html">I've made a small page with some pictures if you are interested</a>
<br><br>
Currently, I work for <a href="https://www.arm.com/">Arm</a> in Cambridge as a Modelling Engineer in the systems performance modelling group within Central Technologies. It's a great job (a first for me!) and I've learned a lot, even though I've only been in the office once between Oct 2020-Oct 2021!
<br><br>
<strong><a href="./work/Resume.pdf">My CV</a></strong> if you are interested.
<br><br>
I like cars and computers, though only together really as an academic exercise. 
I don't think I'd own an autonomous car - I really like driving and the interaction between driver and vehicle, which is why I tend to prefer older cars as well. Viva la Lotus Elan!
<br><br>
I am a sucker for fun to drive, characterful, involving, small cars (especially hatchbacks!). Currently, I own a 2008 (MK1) Ford Ka - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA0yq_7sig4">and it's a YouTube star!</a> For what it is, it's very good. Easy to drive, excellent gearbox and chassis, cheap to run, and the engine is both torquey and seemingly unburstable. It is slow, though... In the past I've owned a 306 GTI-6, MG ZS 180, a MK4/5 (Puma-gen) Fiesta Zetec-S and an E36 328is. I'm pining for a quick Honda now.<br><br>
I also do have an interest in F1 - and a very strong one in historic F1. <a href=./f1/>I've created an F1 driver rating system based on the Glicko-2 ratings system</a>, which I think is an interesting way to compare drivers from across the eras.<br><br>
I <i>really</i> like Unix and Unix-like systems, as well as distributed systems (I just think they're neat!) and embedded systems. I do prefer programming in C, it's where I feel most comfortable, but sometimes I use python or javascript if using C is just going to be an enormous pain.
<br><br>
I'm also interested in history, philosophy, politics and science in general. I am a bit of a <a href="./me/chart.png">bleeding heart liberal</a>, but don't let that put you off. I love reading about the development of thought, reason, culture, and langauge; as well as how we came to structure our societies.
<br><br>
I've also now got quite into mechanical keyboards. I currently have a <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/gmmk-full-brown-switch">GMMK Full Size ANSI</a> with <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-clicks">NovelKeys x Kailh Box Navy</a> switchs and <a href="https://matt3o.com/susuwatari-production-prototypes-tldr-they-are-awesome/">MT3 profile Susuwatari keycaps</a>. Hopefully I'll get to try some beam and buckling spring keyboards in the future!
<br><br>
I also really love rats. Although we're no longer breeding them, and we have a lovely mischief of silly little bumheads.
<br><br>
I also love my two cats, even though one occasionally pees in random places, and the other requires constant attention and sometimes eats out of the bin.
<br><br>
I've also struggled with various mental health issues over the years, specifically Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and Autism (though the latter two are not mental illnesses in and of themselves). My ADHD is now finally diagnosed and medicated, which is a big improvement, but the combination of these conditions still present daily challenges.
