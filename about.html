Hello. My name is Ryan! I'm an English-born, Canadian-raised nerd currently residing in Bedford (techically <a href="https://elstow.weebly.com/">Elstow</a> but who knows where that is?).
I have studied a fair bit of computer and vehicle related things, and am currently <a href="./work.html"><b>looking for a job!</b></a>
<br><br>
I am basically interested in anything human-made that moves or computes, especially if it was built in the mid-20th century. I also love bookends of any subject - the best and the worst, slowest and fastest, oldest and newest, etc.
<br><br>
I have had this webspace for ages but I've only recently had the motivation to properly redo this website. I used to have my email hosted here too, but I had a lot of issues with it being marked as spam even <i>after</i> I got all the DKIM stuff sorted. C'est la vie I suppose.
<br><br>
I hold a <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/future-students/undergraduate/explore-programs/software-engineering">BSc in Software Engineering</a> and an <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/courses/taught/advanced-motorsport-mechatronics">MSc in Motorsports Mechatronics</a>; 
and I studied for a period in <a href="https://eei.uvigo.es/eei_es/estudos/graos/enxenaria-mecanica/">Mechanical Engineering</a> and did around a year of <a href="https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-opportunities">PhD research</a> on multiactuated vehicles. 
I like cars and computers, though only together really as an academic exercise. 
I don't think I'd own an autonomous car - I really like driving and the interaction between driver and vehicle, which is why I tend to prefer older cars as well. Viva la Lotus Elan!
<br><br>
I <i>really</i> like Unix and Unix-like systems, as well as distributed systems (I just think they're neat!) and embedded systems. I do prefer programming in C, it's where I feel most comfortable, but sometimes I use python or javascript if using C is just going to be an enormous pain.
<br><br>
I'm also interested in history, philosophy, politics and science in general. I am a bit of a <a href="./chart.png">bleeding heart liberal</a>, but don't let that put you off. I love reading about the development of thought, reason, culture, and langauge; as well as how we came to structure our societies.
<br><br>
I also really love rats. I have over 10 and have more on the way. They are lovely little people.
<br><br>
I also love my cat, even if he is a dick.
<br><br>
Below this, I'll probably add links to more things about me.
